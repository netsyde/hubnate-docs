## Making a donation

### 1. Connect to Hubnate

Click on the Connect button located at the top of the site.

### 2. Select a donation pool

Each pool has its own characteristics. Select a pool from the list and click on the Donate button.

### 3. Donate

Specify the number of tokens you want to donate. Please note that the cost of 1 chance token in different pools may differ. Click on the Approve button to allow you to spend your ERC-20 tokens. Then click on the Donate button to make a donation.

### 4. Take the CT tokens

After the donation is distributed, you can get the chance-tokens. To do this, go to the Account tab in the Sended subsection. This tab displays all the donations that you have made. To get CT tokens for a donation, click on the Claim button next to the donation.

Please note that if you have a high chance of receiving a donation, your donation can be returned to you. In this case, you will not be able to get the chance tokens.

### 5. Make sure that the chance has increased

Go back to the pool page and make sure that your chance of getting the next donation has increased.
