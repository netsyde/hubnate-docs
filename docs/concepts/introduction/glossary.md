## Core

Smart contracts that are essential for Hubnate to exist.

## ERC20

Tokens of the [**ERC20**](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) standard - fungibile tokens in the BSC network. Hubnate supports all standard ERC20 implementations.

## Pool

A pool is a separate element of the Hubnate protocol that is necessary for making donations. Each pool has its own unique characteristics, including: token, CT-token, cost of CT token.

## Donate

Donate - a voluntary financial donation in the form of [**ERC20 tokens**](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/). Donates are distributed randomly, depending on the chance. For making a donation, the user gets a chance-tokens.

## Chance Ticket Token (CT Token)

CT-token - [**ERC20-token**](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/), which stores information about its holders. Each time the token is moved, the information is automatically updated. CT-token is used to determine the chance of receiving a donation. The more chance tokens you have, the higher your chance. To get the chance tokens of a certain pool, you need to make a donation to this pool.

## Oracle

A blockchain oracle is a reliable data source that sends information to the blockchain for use by smart contracts.
